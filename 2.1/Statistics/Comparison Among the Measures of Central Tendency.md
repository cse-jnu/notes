## Brief
- **Definition**: All measures are rigidly defined, meaning they have clear, mathematical formulas.
- **Data restriction**: AM, M, and Mₐ have no restrictions on data, but GM and HM require values to be nonzero (and GM requires positive values).
- **Computation**: AM, M, and Mₐ are easy to compute, while GM and HM are slightly more difficult due to their formulas.
- **Based upon all observations**: AM, GM, and HM use all data points, whereas M and Mₐ do not (they focus on specific positions or frequencies).
- **Effect of extreme values**: AM and HM are somewhat affected by extreme values, GM is not, and M and Mₐ are also unaffected.
- **Sampling fluctuation**: AM, GM, and HM show little fluctuation with sampling, while M and Mₐ show much more.
- **Graphical location**: M and Mₐ can be located graphically (e.g., on a histogram), but AM, GM, and HM cannot.
- **Further algebraic treatment**: AM and GM can be used in further algebraic manipulations, but HM, M, and Mₐ cannot.

This table helps in choosing the appropriate measure depending on the data and analysis needs. For example, HM is useful for rates (like speeds or work per unit).
