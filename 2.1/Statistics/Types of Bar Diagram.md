## Bar diagrams (or bar charts) are versatile graphical representations that use rectangular bars to display data. The height or length of each bar represents the value of a category.

### 1. **Simple Bar Diagram**
- **Description**: Displays a single set of data with one bar per category.
- **Example**: Average values of AM, GM, and HM for a dataset.
  - Data: AM = 20, GM = 18, HM = 15
  - Chart: One bar per measure with heights 20, 18, and 15.

### 2. **Multiple Bar Diagram**
- **Description**: Compares two or more sets of data side by side for each category using grouped bars.
- **Example**: AM, GM, and HM values across two datasets (e.g., Dataset 1: AM=20, GM=18, HM=15; Dataset 2: AM=22, GM=19, HM=16).
  - Chart: Three bars per category (AM, GM, HM), grouped for each dataset.

### 3. **Stacked Bar Diagram** (Interpreted as "Component")
- **Description**: Shows the total value of each category with segments representing sub-categories, stacked vertically.
- **Example**: Total "effectiveness score" (50) for each measure, split into "ease of computation" (AM=20, GM=15, HM=10) and "resistance to extreme values" (AM=30, GM=35, HM=40).
  - Chart: A bar for each measure (AM, GM, HM), with stacked segments for the two criteria.
