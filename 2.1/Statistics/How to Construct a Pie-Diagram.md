**How to Construct:**

1. *Draw a circle* to represent the **whole data set**.

2. For each category, calculate the **“slice” size**. A circle has *360 degrees*. So, slice size = **360 × (category relative frequency)**.

3. *Divide the circle* into slices according to their **sizes**.

4. Label the slices with the **distinct categories** and their *relative frequencies*.

- To construct a pie chart by hand, use a *protractor* to **approximate the angles** for each slice.

**When to use:** To display *categorical data* with a **relatively small number of categories**.

**What to look for:** How the categories are distributed. To interpret the categories that form **large** and *small proportions* of the **whole data set**.
